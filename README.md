### Multiple Inheritance
#### STATUS: Reference (Completed Draft), Exercises (TODO)

Multiple Inheritance is a way of inheriting from more than one parent class.
It is a difficult topic that requires a deep understanding of classes and inheritance to use well.
These notebooks work from the assumption that you have covered inheritance, and understand getters/setters.
The design is to focus on minimal examples that expose the complexity of Multiple Inheritance.
It's not practical to show 'real' examples as they will be highly custom.
These tutorials focus on giving the reader an understanding of the kinds of strucrues and issues they should consder if they use this technique.
